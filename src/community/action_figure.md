Create an image of an action figure in packaging labeled "Machine Learning Engineer" - a professional who thrives at the intersection of advanced technology and finance. Use the attached photo as a reference for his face. The figure stands approximately 6 feet tall and is dressed in a modern, casual style featuring a classic 2000s band t-shirt (such as Sum41 or Blink-182) paired with slim-fit dark jeans and timeless sneakers (like Converse or Vans). He accessorizes with stylish glasses and a contemporary smartwatch, while holding a smartphone that displays a dynamic dashboard combining real-time financial market data with machine learning analytics.

The cardboard packaging should reflect a futuristic, high-tech aesthetic—melding sleek steel gray, dark blue, and cyber green hues with subtle neon accents—symbolizing the innovative convergence of tech and finance.

Include an "Essential Gear" section featuring these three key accessories:
• High-Performance Ultrabook: Adorned with tech, finance, and 2000s band stickers, signifying its power and cultural flair.
• Dual-Monitor Setup: Displaying interactive data analytics and algorithmic trading visuals, essential for crunching complex datasets.
• Monster Energy Drink: The ultimate fuel for powering through coding marathons and late-night problem-solving.

Design the packaging to be visually engaging, playful, and tech-savvy, celebrating the unique synergy between machine learning innovation, financial technology, and the nostalgic energy of 2000s punk rock culture. Ensure that while the action figure remains unseen inside the packaging, the focus is on the meticulously crafted accessories and thematic branding.
